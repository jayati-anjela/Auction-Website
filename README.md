## Auction Website

<p>An e-commerce website is a website that allows people to buy and sell physical goods, services, and digital products over the internet rather than a physical location.</p>

<br>

<p>The goal is to develop an online shopping platform that will enable customers to purchase home furniture and decor. There are 3 categories: furniture, vases and wall art for the customers to choose from. Users will have the choice to put their favorite items in shopping cart and pay for the items.</p>
